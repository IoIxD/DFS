<p>this website is connected to a discord bot that you can invite to any of your servers that has discord forums, and it will be formatted as a plaintext forum. you can't interact with this forum but hopefully this will at least let these forum channels show up to google (though, we need somebody good at SEO to help with that)</p>
<p>the site is also (hopefully) simple enough that you can print the contents of it to another site, and thus if you want your own url for this stuff you can simply include the site from your own site, via whatever language you plan on using.</p>

<p>you can invite the bot <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1019734546612224072&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=3533888">here.</a></p>
