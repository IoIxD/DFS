# Pull Request

### Describe it here:

...

### I have made sure all the things still work:

- [ ] The index page and privacy policy page is still served
- [ ] The sitemap isn't broken.
- [ ] The guild listing is still functioning
- [ ] A guild's message listing is still functioning.
- [Any but not all of the posts in the test forum](https://dforum.org/1020045037372964974/1020049276082073630) are working; you are invited to invite your self-host to the server to actually index this.
- [ ] Finally, it's curtious but not required to check if the website still renders correctly on an older browser. [RetroZilla, based on Firefox 2.0, is the current standard](https://rn10950.github.io/RetroZillaWeb/) If you do this feel free to provide a screenshot.
