## Pull Request

#### Describe it here:

...

#### I have made sure all the things still work:

- [ ] The index page and privacy policy page is still served
- [ ] The sitemap isn't broken.
- [ ] The guild listing [(example)](http://localhost:8084/592399417676529688) is still functioning
- [ ] A guild's message listing [(example)](http://localhost:8084/592399417676529688/1015021717900513363) is still functioning.
- The following post pages are still functioning:
    - [ ] [Why the Slash Commands? Why aren't my images working?](http://localhost:8084/592399417676529688/1015021717900513363/1015031189779796099) (very complete page that showcases most of the features)
    - [ ] [Any but not all of the posts in the test forum](https://dforum.org/1020045037372964974/1020049276082073630)
- [ ] Finally, it's curtious but not required to check if the website still renders correctly on an older browser. [RetroZilla, based on Firefox 2.0, is the current standard](https://rn10950.github.io/RetroZillaWeb/) If you do this feel free to provide a screenshot.
